					<h2>What is Conversion Rate Optimisation?</h2>
					<p>
						Conversion Rate Optimisation is the process of increasing your sales, signups or leads by using methods to test different versions of your site in combination with analytics to read the results.
					</p>

					<h2>The Process</h2>
					<h3>Analytics</h3>
					<p>
						The first step is to ensure that your visitor tracking (Analytics / Tag Manager) is correctly set up to gather data about your prospective customers. If you do not have either of these set up on your website then these will be installed.
					</p>
					<h3>Conversion Flow</h3>
					<p>
						Your conversion flow is mapped out so that we can identify the steps that a typical customer takes on their journey from landing on your website to the conversion goals you desire.
					</p>
					<h3>Opportunities</h3>
					<p>
						After we have set up your visitor tracking we will Analyse your data to try to spot opportunities to increase your Conversions (Sales, Lead Signups, or any specific goal).
					</p>
					<p>
						These may include, but are not limited to:
					</p>
					<ul class="circle">
						<li>Checkout / Signup Form Optimisation (Reducing the number of steps needed to complete a form, tracking of form abandonments, use of techniques to encourage customers to finish the checkout process after they have abandoned.)</li>
						<li>Landing page optimisation (Editing of the pages that your visitors land on to reduce visitor drop-offs).</li>
						<li>A/B Split testing (Testing one version of a page against a variant to see which performs better).</li>
						<li>Increasing the overall website speed (This may have the additional benefit of increasing your search positions).</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="border:1px dashed #333; padding:10px; background-color:#f0f0f0;">
						There is no one-size fits all solution for all websites, the solutions proposed to you will be tailored uniquely to your website. We test our solutions by comparing the data of your conversions and compare with previous conversion rates so that you can see for yourself that our process works.

          <h2>What is Google Adwords?</h2>
          <p>
            Google Adwords is the worlds largest online advertising network. Adwords is used by many of the leading brands and millions of individuals to increase the revenue generated by their business online.
          </p>
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            Adverts place using Google Adwords appear on the Google search engine and on the Google Display network.
          </p>
          <h2>The Process</h2>
          <p>
            <ul class="no-bullet">
              <li>An advertiser places an advert on Google Adwords using the keyphrase "flowers".</li>
              <li>A user searching using Google enters a keyphrase such as "flowers".</li>
              <li>The advert is shown in the search results to the user.</li>
              <li>The user clicks on the advert.</li>
              <li>The user is taken to the advertisers website.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>Why use Adwords?</h2>
          <p>
